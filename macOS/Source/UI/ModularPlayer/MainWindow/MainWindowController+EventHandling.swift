    /*
        "Residual scrolling" occurs when seeking forward to the end of a playing track (scrolling right), resulting in the next track playing while the scroll is still occurring. Inertia (i.e. the momentum phase of the scroll) can cause scrolling, and hence seeking, to continue after the new track has begun playing. This is undesirable behavior. The scrolling should stop when the new track begins playing.
     
        To prevent residual scrolling, we need to take into account the following variables:
        - the time when the scroll session began
        - the time when the new track began playing
        - the time interval between this event and the last event
     
        Returns a value indicating whether or not this event constitutes residual scroll.
